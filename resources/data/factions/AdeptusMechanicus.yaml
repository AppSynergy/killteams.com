        At the start of each battle round, pick which Canticle of the Omnissiah is in effect until the end of the battle round. The same Canticle may not be picked twice during the same battle.

        Alternatively, you can randomly determine which Canticle of the Omnissiah is in effect by rolling a D6 and consulting the table. Note that if you randomly determine a Canticle, it takes effect even if the same Canticle has been in effect earlier in the battle.
